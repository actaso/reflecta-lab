# User Alignment Doc
The purpose of this doc is to keep a log of the current goals, agreements, and focus areas for the client that is used to personalize the coaching sessions as well as decide how to send messages to the user throughout the week.

Below, you find the structure of the doc with detailed instructions on how to upate it/fill it out. It is split in a client-input section which strictly only uses information that has been shared by the client and a coach-observations section in which observations from the coach are captured.
